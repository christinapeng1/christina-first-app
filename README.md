## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite 3 applications
- Discord
  1) Wide selection of emojis
  2) Easily updatable statuses
- Google Calendar
  1) Intuitive calendar-structured interface
  2) You can easily add an event with a single tap on any empty space of time.
- Among Us
  1) Easy for the game character to move
  2) You can customize how your character looks with left-right arrow clicks

An app idea I want to build is an app for playing Secret Hitler/Werewolf. The MVP version would be a simple app where you can create a game, set custom roles or game settings, and then receive a join code you can pass on to friends. Then, friends can enter the join code and everyone can play a match of Werewolf/Secret Hitler. The more elaborate version I would love is to make it allow players to join voice chat and participate in active discussion. This way you can play online with strangers and make friends.

## Notes

One challenge I encountered was removing a deleted connection. I accidentally created an IBOutlet at first and then removed it to create an IBAction. But then my app was running into errors until I went to the Connection Inspector and deleted the old connection associated with the IBOutlet.
